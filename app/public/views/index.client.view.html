	<span><p>This web app helps users rich share. What is rich sharing? Rich sharing is when your post include an image and description and title in the links. Think facebook previews. </p></span>
	<span><p> Rich sharing is easy when you run your own site but some people who lease a website where they don't control the code or backend or people who have blogs on single page applications much have difficulty posting the content they want.
	This application helps you edit your post to be shared exactly the way you like.</p></span>
	<span><p> Add your link, description and the url location of the image you want to appear on social media. </p></span>
	<span><ul> How it works </ol>
							<li> Fill in the form with the image you want to show, description, and title on social media </li>
							<li> Fill in the form with the link you want users to go to</li>
